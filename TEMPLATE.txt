FOLLOWING ARE THE ERRORS I FACED DURING COMPLETING THE ASSIGNMENT:
HASSAN JAWWAD 20L-1122 F 

LINE no: 84 in bigint.cpp
1)I was using object.[i] in a loop whereas I had not declared it so later I got the point and used test the object I had made:

before(error): if (object.v[i] != 0)
after: if (test.v[i] != 0)

LINE no: 99 IN bigint.cpp
1)I was returning output in the ofstream operator whereas I had declared out in the function 
it was resolved later by returning out:

before(error): return output;
after:return out;

LINE no: 117 in bigint.cpp
3)I was using pow built in function without including the library cmath in the visual studio it was giving an error 

before(error): memory = memory * (pow(10, POW));
after: #include<cmath>
 memory = memory * (pow(10, POW));

LINE no: 131 in bigint.cpp
4)I was incrementing i without initializing it 
before(error):int i; 
(;i<SIZE;i++)
after:int i=0;
(;i<SIZE;i++)

LINE no: 2 in driver.cpp
5)I was including header file with the wrong name in driver.cpp
before(error):#include"Bigint.h"
after:#include"bigint.h"
